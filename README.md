# My own suckless programs fork
 To install do a ``sudo/doas make install`` in it's respective directory.
 Make sure config.h is deleted every time you re-make these suckless programms.
 I added it to the Makefile so you don't have to but always check.

 These include:
  - DWM (Dynamic Window Manager)
  - Surf (Suckless Browser)
  - Tabbed (To have tab functionality)
  - And ST (Simple Terminal) Coming Soon.

  Dynamic Window Manager:
  - Patch: Gaps
  - Keybind: Mod+Shift+q to quit an application
  - Keybind: Mod+Shift+e to quit xorg
  - Keybind: Mod+Shift+f opens firefox
  - Keybind: Mod+Shift+t opens thunar
  - The rest are the default onces.

  Surf: 
  - All the default :)

  Tabbed: 
  - Keybind: Some of the defaults if you find anything please make a pull request

  Simple Terminal:
  - Coming soon.

## Contributing:
  You can contribute by sending a pull request. But please read the following:
  - Please do not change the appearance
  - Neither the keybinds. I don't care if it's "more ergonomical"
