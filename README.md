 To install do a ``sudo/doas make install`` in it's respective directory.
 Make sure config.h is deleted every time you re-make these suckless programms.
 I added it to the Makefile so you don't have to but always check.

 These include:
  - DWM (Dynamic Window Manager)
  - Surf (Suckless Browser)
  - Tabbed (To have tab functionality)
  - And ST (Simple Terminal) Coming Soon.

  Dynamic Window Manager:

  - Keybind: Mod+Shift+e to quit xorg

## Forking:
  I don't know why you would want to fork this repo but sure, go ahead. Just
  mention that you got it from me.

## Contributing:
  You can contribute by sending a pull request. But please read the following:
  - Please do not change the appearance
  - Neither the keybinds. I don't care if it's "more ergonomical"
